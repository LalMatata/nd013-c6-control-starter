// Answer the following questions:

// Add the plots to your report and explain them (describe what you see)
// What is the effect of the PID according to the plots, how each part of the PID affects the control command?

PID using proportional value navigate toward goal

P(proportional) values is calculated from current error only. 
Produce constant steady-state error


I(Integral) values is calculated from cumulative error.
Reduce or eliminate steady-state error

D(Derivative) values is calculated from difference between current and past error.
Reduce rate of change error

// How would you design a way to automatically tune the PID parameters?

Using twiddle algorithm, search around one parameter than another

// PID controller is a model free controller, i.e. it does not use a model of the car. Could you explain the pros and cons of this type of controller?

Pros: Simple logic, easy to train
Cons: Tuning complicate, hard to expand to complex tunning

// (Optional) What would you do to improve the PID controller?
